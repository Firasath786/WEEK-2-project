EXTRACT THIS PROJECT FROM DVD DATA BASE.I had an amazing experiance playing with SQL.
SQL-Data Analytics Course
 I Have performed data analysis using SQL.
 EXTRACT this from DVD DATA BASE.I enjoyed playing with SQL.
I used various tables to fetch required data like actor,film ,film_actor,customer,payment,address,weekly and monthly ,rental etc to get their outcomes.
I have used the queries given during class and pushed to the repository the output along with respective SQL.
In addition I have also written 10 SQL queries by my self which also I pushed to this repository along the outputs.
In game-4 SQL- Output is not having any data.so no csv file for this.
In game-5 SQL-Staff do not share the last name with the actor...so no csv file for this.
I have used  various SQL techniques like self join, natural join, subqueries,  difference, exists, window function,CTEs.
